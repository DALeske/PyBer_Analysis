# Module 5 Challenge: PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pyber's leadership a summary of the ride-sharing by city type (urban, suburban, and rural) for January 1, 2019 through May 8, 2019 and to provide recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types.  A summary of Pyber's ride-sharing data by city type for January 1, 2019 through May 8, 2019 is provided as well as a visualization of weekly fare trends by city type for the period January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019.


## Results
During the analyzed period, the majority (68%) of rides initiated within urban cities, followed by 26% of rides initiating within suburban cities, and 5% within rural cities. There number of driver in each city type corresponded with the ride volume, with 81% of the drivers from urban cities, 16% from suburban cities, and 3% from rural cities. Given the number of rides for each city type, it is not surprising that the total fares was the highest for urban cities and lowest for rural cities. However, the average fare was actually highest for rural cities and lowest for urban cities. Taking total fares and the number of drivers into account, the average fare per drive was highest for rural cities and lowest for urban cities.  Results are shown in the table below.

Looking at the weekly total fares by city type for the period January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019, the same relationship noted in the overall ride summary is seen over the entire sampled period, with the highest total fares generated in urban cities and the lowest total fares generated in rural cities. Temporal increases and decreases in total fares appeared to follow the same trends by city type, as illustrated by the increase in total fares for all city types during the last week of February, 2019. After a relatively slow start in January, fares essentially remained stable for the remainder of the time period for all city types.

## Summary
After reviewing the ride-sharing data for the analysis period, the following recommendations are given for consideration:

1. Reduce the number of urban drivers: While urban drivers accounted for 81% of the total Pyber drivers, urban rides only accounted for 68% of the total rides, suggesting that a lower number of drivers may be able to provide the same level of service to our urban riders.

2. Consider increasing the number of rural drivers: While the total fares for rural rides accounted for the lowest total fares, the average fare per ride was the highest for rural cities. In addition, the average fare per driver was highest for rural cities. The differential between average fare per ride and average fare per driver for rural cities would indicate that these drivers spend more time with active riders than their urban counterparts.

3. Consider increasing the number of suburban drivers: For the same reasons stated for rural drivers (see #2 above), the suburban drivers each provide a higher rate of return than their urban counterparts. 

4. Given the suggestions for decreasing the number of urban drivers and increasing the number of rural and suburban drivers, shifting drivers from urban cities to rural and suburban cities may increase profits. However, prior to making any of the above changes, a detailed analysis of the demand for rides would need to be conducted.  If demand is currently met in either rural or suburban cities, increasing the number of drivers in those cities would not be recommended. In contrast, the case for reducing the number of drivers in the urban cities would still be recommended, given than demand is clearly being met in urban cities currently.
